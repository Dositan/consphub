# consphub
A web-site designed to share your conspectus', abstracts, whatever they are called with other students

## The idea behind naming
In our school there is a lot of stuff you must write or somehow memorize. Sometimes you just don't have time for that. I personally faced this issue, so I got an idea of creating a whole full-stuck website (first time) that would really save students' lives.

## What's going to happen
Well, the development is not going to be that fast, since I have my classes you know :)

Approximately, everything should take a couple of months.
In that amount of time I'll be able to write great CSS, awesome Django and incredible JS.

## The functionality
Imagine a social media, like Instagram, where you post your notes by leaving some useful-for-searching tags, like #biology; #11 #nis etc.

Tags (or categories idk) will play the role when you are searching for a specific topic, page and so on.

The web-app has to have school-accounts (scounts sounds nice) which may have subscounts, such as 9D, that have their own kinda chat (man this will take decades)

I hope you got the idea, it is amazing but we have no code yet which isn't cool.
